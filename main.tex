\section*{Introduction}
Skolemization is the replacement of an axiom of the form
\begin{equation}\label{allexist}
\forall\vec{x}~\exists y~\phi(\vec{x},y)
\end{equation}
by one of the form
\begin{equation}\label{allskol}
\forall\vec{x}~\phi(\vec{x},f_\phi(\vec{x})),
\end{equation}
where $f_\phi$ is a fresh function symbol, also called a Skolem function.
Without essential loss of generality we shall from now on take $\phi$ atomic
and of arity $\leq 2$ in (\ref{allexist}) and (\ref{allskol}). This means
that $\vec{x}$ has length at most one and that the Skolem function is
unary or nullary, in which case we speak of a Skolem constant.

Clearly, (\ref{allskol}) is stronger than (\ref{allexist}).
Nevertheless, Skolem's Theorem states that skolemization is \emph{conservative}
for classical first-order logic. This means that classical consequences of
(\ref{allskol}) not containing $f_\phi$ already follow from (\ref{allexist}).

Semantically, Skolem's Theorem follows from the observation that
any model of (\ref{allexist}) can be extended with an interpretation
of $f_\phi$ to satisfy (\ref{allskol}). This simple, elegant argument has two
drawbacks. First, the interpretation of $f_\phi$ uses the Axiom of Choice.
Second, the argument does not explain how to transform proofs using
(\ref{allskol}) into proofs using (\ref{allexist}).
Of course, the mere existence of such a proof transformation
follows from the semantical argument by applying soundness and completeness.

From the proof theoretic point of view one would like to understand
in a combinatorial way how to transform proofs using (\ref{allskol}) into proofs
using  (\ref{allexist}).  Here and below we restrict attention to
proofs with conclusion not containing $f_\phi$. After all, such proofs are finite
combinatorial objects and will not use the Skolem function in its entirety.
Such a proof transformation exists and has been defined by Maehara~\cite{Maehara}. 
In view of the simplicity of the semantical argument, the proof transformation
contains two surprises.
First, the transformed proofs can be much longer than the original, see \cite{xxx}.
Second, as we shall see below, in certain cases the transformed proofs must use
the law of the excluded middle even if the original proof does not.

One natural question is whether Skolem's Theorem holds for other logics as well.
We first consider constructive logic. Surprisingly, Skolem's Theorem fails
for constructive logic, a result which is due to Mints~\cite{Mints}.
Consider the sentence
\begin{equation}\label{all2exist2}
\forall x_1,x_2~\exists y_1,y_2.~P(x_1,y_1) \land P(x_2,y_2) \land (x_1 = x_2 \to y_1 = y_2)
\end{equation}
Clearly,  (\ref{all2exist2}) follows from (\ref{allskol}) by taking $y_i = f(x_i)$.
In an attempt to prove (\ref{all2exist2}) from (\ref{allexist}), let $x_1,x_2$ be given.
Using (\ref{allexist}) we can get $y_1,y_2$ satisfying the first two conjuncts
in (\ref{all2exist2}). However, (\ref{allexist}) does not guarantee the third conjunct.
For this we would have to decide $ x_1 = x_2 \lor x_1 \neq x_2$ before the
application of (\ref{allexist}). In constructive logic, equality is in general not decidable.
We shall prove below that indeed (\ref{all2exist2}) does not follow from  (\ref{allexist})
in constructive logic, using an argument different from \cite{Mints}.
The failure of Skolem's Theorem for constructive logic can be remedied by 
requiring in (\ref{allexist}) unique existence instead of existence, see \cite{xxx}.
This, of course, results in a weaker Skolem's Theorem for constructive logic.

Coherent logic is a fragment of first-order logic described in the next section.



\section{Coherent theories}\label{coherent}
 
We use letters $r,s,t,\dots$ for terms, $x,y,z,u,\dots$ for variables,
and $P,Q,R,\ldots$ for predicates.

\medskip

Given a signature $\Sigma$ we consider a theory $T$ with axioms of the form
$$
\Delta_0(\vec{y})~\vdash_{\vec{y}}~
\exists \vec{z_1}\Delta_1(\vec{y},\vec{z_1})\vee\dots\vee\exists \vec{z_n}\Delta_n(\vec{y},\vec{z_n})
$$
where $\Gamma(\vec{y}), \Delta(\vec{y}),\dots$ denote conjunctions of atomic formulae
all free variables of which are in $\vec{y}$, thought of as a finite sets of atomic formulae.
Such sets, as well as the sequences of variables, can be empty, 
and we can have axioms with $n=0$. 
We write $\Gamma,\Delta$ for the union of $\Gamma$ and $\Delta$.

 We define inductively when we have $\Gamma\vdash_{\vec{x}}^T A$ where $A$ is a atomic formula
and all free variables of $\Gamma,A$ are in $\vec{x}$. There are two clauses:

\begin{enumerate}
\item (base) $A$ is in $\Gamma$ 

\item (step) there is an axiom 
$$
\Delta_0(\vec{y})~\vdash_{\vec{y}}~
\exists \vec{z_1}\Delta_1(\vec{y},\vec{z_1})\vee\dots\vee\exists \vec{z_n}\Delta_n(\vec{y},\vec{z_n})
$$
in $T$ and a sequence of terms $\vec{t}$ with variables in $\vec{x}$,
such that $\Delta_0(\vec{t})$ is a subset of $\Gamma$ and
we have 
$$
\Gamma,\Delta_i(\vec{t},\vec{z_i})\vdash^T_{\vec{x},\vec{z_i}} A
\quad \text{for all $i = 1,\dots,n$.}
$$
\end{enumerate}

In the special case $n=0$ this means that $\Gamma\vdash_{\vec{x}} A$ for any $A$ if $\Gamma$
includes a finite set $\Delta_0(\vec{t})$. This shows that $\bot$ (absurdity) in coherent logic
is represented by the empty disjunction, satisfying the Ex Falso rule. Dually, we have $\top$
in coherent logic represented by  the empty conjunction (set of atoms), 
which is true in any $\Gamma$.
% left out remark on inconsistency that I didn't understand

\section{Skolem constants}\label{sec:skolemconstant}

Coherent is a logic that, unlike ordinary first-order logic with Tarski semantics,
allows the domain to be empty. This means that adding a constant to a signature
that does not contain constant symbols is \emph{not} conservative.
As an example, consider the rule $\vdash_{y} P$ for a proposition $P$.
Now we can only infer $\vdash P$ if we have a constant in the signature.

Skolemization with constants is conservative, and the proof is simpler than,
but slightly different from, the case of Skolem functions.
Therefore we deal with Skolem constants in this section first.
This will also give us a good picture of what we need to prove
the case of Skolem functions.

%TODO Without loss of generality we take $\phi$ to be $P$
Let $T$ be a coherent theory with $\vdash\exists y P(y)$ among its axioms.
Replace this axiom by $\vdash P(c)$ for a fresh constant $c$
and call the resulting theory $T_c$. 

\begin{theorem}
If $\Gamma,A$ does not mention $c$ and $\Gamma\vdash_{\vec{x}}^{T_c} A$, then
$\Gamma\vdash_{\vec{x}}^{T} A$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
If $\Gamma\vdash_{\vec{x}}^{T_c} A$, then $\Gamma,P(c)\vdash_{\vec{x}}^{T_c} A$
by weakening, to be proved in Lemma~\ref{weak}.
From the resulting proof we remove all now pre-empted applications of
the axiom $\vdash P(c)$. We then
replace every occurrence of $c$ by a fresh variable $u$ and 
get a proof of $\Gamma,P(u)\vdash_{\vec{x},u}^{T} A$.
This substitution operation will be defined in Section~\ref{auxlemmas}
and leaves $\Gamma,A$ unchanged.
It also replaces $c$ by $u$ in instantiations of axioms of $T_c$,
which is important to get a proof in $T$. Finally,
by applying the axiom $\vdash\exists y P(y)$ in $T$ 
we get a proof of $\Gamma\vdash_{\vec{x}}^{T} A$.
\end{proof}

Skolem constants are special since the axiom $\vdash\exists y P(y)$
makes the domain non-empty, which is not true for $\vdash_x\exists y P(x,y)$.
From now on we assume that the Skolem function has positive arity.

\section{Some Lemmas}\label{auxlemmas}

%% \begin{lemma}\label{rename}
%% If $\sigma$ is a renaming on variables and
%% $\Gamma\vdash_{\vec{x}}^T A$ then $\Gamma\sigma\vdash_{\vec{x},z}^T A\sigma$.
%% \end{lemma}

\begin{lemma}\label{weak}
If $\Gamma\vdash_{\vec{x}}^T A$, $\vec{x}\subseteq \vec{y}$, $\Gamma\subseteq \Sigma$ and all free variables of $\Sigma$ are in $\vec{y}$, then $\Sigma\vdash_{\vec{y}}^T A$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{lemma}\label{subst1}
If $\vec{t} = t_1,\dots,t_n$ are terms using free variables in $\vec{y}$ and
$\Gamma\vdash_{x_1,\dots,x_n}^T A$ then $\Gamma(\vec{t})\vdash_{\vec{y}}^T A(\vec{t})$.
\end{lemma}

We will continue using ordinary substitution of variables by terms implicitly, such as in,
for example, $\Delta_0(\vec{t})$. In proving Skolem's Theorem we also need to
substitute variables for terms. This we denote explicitly.
For $r$ be a term, and $u$ a variable, we denote by $\rho = \rho_{r,u}$ the 
substitution of $r$ by $u$, inductively defined on terms by
\begin{itemize}
\item $s\rho = u$ if $s = r$, and otherwise
\item $f(\vec{t})\rho = f(\vec{t}\rho)$
\item $x\rho = x$
\end{itemize}
We extend in the usual way by taking $P(\vec{t})\rho = P(\vec{t}\rho)$ for
predicate symbols  $P$, and likewise for sets of atoms. 
One subtlety in the interaction of the two notions of subtitution is that for an
atomic formula $\phi(\vec{x})$ in free variables $\vec{x}$ and
a sequence of terms $\vec{t}$, $\phi(\vec{t})\rho$
can be different from $\phi(\vec{t}\rho)$ when $\phi(\vec{x})$
contains the term $r$. For example, if  $\phi(x) = P(r,x)$
and $t=r$, then $\phi(t)\rho = P(u,u)$ and $\phi(t\rho) = P(r,u)$.
Even worse, if $\phi(x) = P(f(x))$ and $t=c$ and $r=f(c)$,
then $\phi(t)\rho = P(u)$ and $\phi(t\rho) = P(f(c))$.
A sufficient condition to rule out these anomalies is given in
the following lemma, whose simple proof we omit.

\begin{lemma}\label{subst0}
If $\rho = \rho_{r,u}$ and the head symbol of $r$ does not occur in 
$\phi(\vec{x})$, then $\phi(\vec{t})\rho =\phi(\vec{t}\rho)$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{lemma}\label{subst2}
Assume $\rho = \rho_{r,u}$ and the head symbol of $r$ does not occur in $T$.
If all free variables of $r$ are in $\vec{x}$ and
$\Gamma\vdash_{\vec{x}}^T A$, then $\Gamma\rho\vdash_{\vec{x},u}^T A\rho$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
By induction on the proof of $\Gamma\vdash_{\vec{x}}^T A$.

If $A$ is in $\Gamma$ then $A\rho$ is in $\Gamma\rho$.

If there is a rule
$$
\Delta_0(\vec{y})~\vdash_{\vec{y}}~
\exists \vec{z_1}\Delta_1(\vec{y},\vec{z_1})\vee\dots\vee\exists \vec{z_n}\Delta_n(\vec{y},\vec{z_n})
$$
in $T$ such that $\Delta_0(\vec{t})$ is a subset of $\Gamma$ and
we have $\Gamma,\Delta_i(\vec{t},\vec{z_i})\vdash^T_{\vec{x},\vec{z_i}} A$ for all $i = 1,\dots,n$,
where $\vec{t}$ are terms using variables in $\vec{x}$, then we have by induction
$\Gamma\rho,\Delta_i(\vec{t},\vec{z_i})\rho\vdash^T_{\vec{x},\vec{z_i},u} A\rho$
for all $i = 1,\dots,n$. 

We want to apply the same rule as above, instantiated
with $\vec{t}\rho$ instead of $\vec{t}$. From Lemma~\ref{subst0} we get that
$\Delta_0(\vec{t}\rho) = \Delta_0(\vec{t})\rho$ is a subset of $\Gamma\rho$.
Also, $\Delta_i(\vec{t},\vec{z_i})\rho = \Delta_i(\vec{t}\rho,\vec{z_i})$ 
for all $i = 1,\dots,n$, since $z\rho = z$ for any variable $z$ in $\vec{z_i}$.
Hence we get
$\Gamma\rho,\Delta_i(\vec{t}\rho,\vec{z_i})\vdash^T_{\vec{x},\vec{z_i},u} A\rho$ for all $i = 1,\dots,n$,
and we can infer $\Gamma\rho\vdash^T_{\vec{x},u} A\rho$ as desired.
\end{proof}

The combination of Lemma~\ref{subst1} and \ref{subst2} makes
substitution of terms for terms possible.

\begin{lemma}\label{cut}
If $\Gamma\vdash_{\vec{x}}^T A$ and $\Delta,A\vdash_{\vec{x}}^T B$ then
$\Gamma,\Delta\vdash_{\vec{x}}^T B$
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
By induction on the proof of $\Gamma\vdash_{\vec{x}}^T A$. If $A$ belongs to $\Gamma$ we can
conclude by Lemma \ref{weak}. 
Otherwise we have a rule
$$
\Delta_0(\vec{y})~\vdash_{\vec{y}}~
\exists \vec{z_1}\Delta_1(\vec{y},\vec{z_1})\vee\dots\vee\exists \vec{z_n}\Delta_n(\vec{y},\vec{z_n})
$$
in $T$ such that $\Delta_0(\vec{t})$ is a subset of $\Gamma$ and
$\Gamma,\Delta_i(\vec{t},\vec{y_i})\vdash_{\vec{x},\vec{y_i}} A$ for all $i$.
By induction, we have $\Gamma,\Delta,\Delta_i(\vec{t},\vec{y_i})\vdash_{\vec{x},\vec{y_i}} B$ for all $i$
and hence $\Gamma,\Delta\vdash_{\vec{x}}^T B$ as desired.
\end{proof}

We will use yet another kind of substitution. We define an operation
$\ldf{}$ that replaces \emph{recursively} any $f$-term by its leftmost subterm. 
We end up with a term which contains no occurrences of $f$.
\begin{itemize}
\item $\ldf{f(\vec{t})} = \ldf{t_1}$, and otherwise
\item $\ldf{g(\vec{t})} = g(\ldf{\vec{t}})$,
\item $\ldf{x} = x$.
\end{itemize}
Again we extend in the usual way for atoms and sets of atoms.
A trivial (but relevant) observation is that all variables in $\ldf{t}$ occur in $t$.

The following lemma implies the conservativity of adding a new
function symbol to the signature.

\begin{lemma}\label{subst3}
Let $T$ be a theory with equality.
Let $T_{f{=}}$ be $T$ extended by the congruence axiom 
$\vec{x}=\vec{y} \vdash_{\vec{x},\vec{y}} f(\vec{x}) = f(\vec{y})$
for a new function symbol $f$. 
Then we have $\ldf{\Gamma}\vdash_{\vec{x}}^T \ldf{A}$
whenever $\Gamma\vdash_{\vec{x}}^{T_{f{=}}} A$.
%by a derivation of the same size.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
By induction on derivation. No axiom of $T$ mentions $f$, which means
that applications of axioms of $T$ commute with $\ldf{}$. The only case of
interest is the application of the  congruence axiom for $f$:
$\vec{s}=\vec{t} \vdash_{\vec{x}} f(\vec{s}) = f(\vec{t})$. Applying $\ldf{}$ we get 
$\vec{s}\ldf{}=\vec{t}\ldf{} \vdash_{\vec{x}} s_1\ldf{} = t_1\ldf{}$,
where the conclusion is among the premisses. This means the congruence
axiom for $f$ can be left out.
\end{proof}
In case of logic without equality, conservativity of extending the signature
is even easier.


\section{Elimination of function symbols}\label{sec:skolemfunction}

In this section we prove Skolem's Theorem for coherent logic without equality.
This case is essentially simpler than the case with equality, 
since here (\ref{allskol}) is the only axiom
mentioning the Skolem function $f$. In logic with equality in the next section
we will also have to deal with the congruence axiom for $f$.

We assume that we have the rule $\vdash_{x}\exists y~P(x,y)$ in $T$.
We introduce a binary function
symbol $f$ which is \emph{not} in the language of $T$. 
We let $T_f$ be the theory $T$ in the signature extended
with the function symbol $f$.
Let $T_{f+}$ be the extension of $T_f$ with the rule
$$
\vdash_{y}~P(y,f(y))\leqno{(*)}
$$

Our aim is to prove that $T_{f{+}}$ is a conservative extension of $T$.
The main idea is that if we use $f$ and the rule
$(*)$ with $P(t,f(t))$ we should be able to replace $f(t)$ by a fresh variable 
and get $P(t,u)$, and then use the axiom $\exists u~P(t,u)$ in $T$.
This idea is cleverly expressed in the crucial Lemma~\ref{crucial} 
(which comes from \cite{Maehara}).

\begin{lemma}\label{simpl}
If $\Gamma,P(t,f(t))\vdash_{\vec{x}}^{T_f} A$ and
$f(t)$ is not in $\Gamma,A$ then $\Gamma\vdash_{\vec{x}}^{T_f} A$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
We take $r = f(t)$ and we use Lemma \ref{subst2}. We get
$\Gamma,P(t,u)\vdash_{\vec{x},u}^{T_f} A$. Since we also have
$\vdash_{\vec{x}}\exists u~P(t,u)$ we get  $\Gamma\vdash_{\vec{x}}^{T_f} A$.
\end{proof}

\begin{corollary}\label{simpl1}
If $\Gamma,P(t_1,f(t_1)),\dots,P(t_n,f(t_n))\vdash_{\vec{x}}^{T_f} A$ and
$f(t_i)$ is not in $\Gamma,A,t_j$ for $1\leq j < i \leq n$,
then $\Gamma\vdash_{\vec{x}}^{T_f} A$.
\end{corollary}


\begin{lemma} \label{crucial} (crucial Lemma) 
If $\Gamma\vdash_{\vec{x}}^{T_{f{+}}} A$ then $\Gamma,\Sigma\vdash_{\vec{x}}^{T_f} A$ for
some set $\Sigma$ of formulae $P(t,f(t))$ where $f(t)$ is a term which occurs in $\Gamma,A$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
By induction on the proof of $\Gamma\vdash_{\vec{x}}^{T_{f{+}}} A$.
The base case is if $A$ is in $\Gamma$. Then we have
$\Gamma,\Sigma\vdash_{\vec{x}}^{T_f} A$ for empty $\Sigma$.
In the step case we distinguish between $(*)$ and other axioms
$$
\Delta_0(\vec{y})~\vdash_{\vec{y}}~
\exists \vec{z_1}\Delta_1(\vec{y},\vec{z_1})\vee\dots\vee\exists \vec{z_n}\Delta_n(\vec{y},\vec{z_n})
$$
in $T$ with $\vec{t}$ terms using free variables in $\vec{x}$ and
we have $\Delta_0(\vec{t})$ subset of $\Gamma$ and
$\Gamma,\Delta_i(\vec{t},\vec{z_i})\vdash_{\vec{x},\vec{z_i}}^{T_{f{+}}} A$ for $i=1,\dots,n$.
By the induction hypothesis we have $\Gamma,\Delta_i(\vec{t},\vec{z_i}), \Sigma_i\vdash_{\vec{x},\vec{z_i}}^{T_f} A$
for $i = 1,\dots,n$, where $\Sigma_i$ is a set of formulae $P(t,f(t))$ where
$f(t)$ occurs in $\Gamma,A,\Delta_i(\vec{t},\vec{z_i})$.
Since $\Delta(\vec{y},\vec{z_i})$ does not mention $f$ and all free variables of $\vec{t}$ are
in $\vec{x}$ it follows that all free variables of $\Sigma_i$ are in $\vec{x}$.
Hence we have $\Gamma,\Sigma_1,\dots,\Sigma_n\vdash_{\vec{x}}^{T_f} A$.
Using Corollary \ref{simpl1} with the $f$-terms in the right order, 
we get the required conclusion.

The last case is that we have used the axiom $(*)$ and
we have $\Gamma,P(t,f(t))\vdash_{\vec{x}}^{T_{f{+}}} A$. By the induction hypothesis we get
$\Gamma,P(t,f(t)),\Sigma \vdash_{\vec{x}}^{T_f} A$ and we are
done using Corollary \ref{simpl1} as in the previous case.
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}\label{thm:skolem}
If $\Gamma,A$ does not mention $f$ and $\Gamma\vdash_{\vec{x}}^{T_{f{+}}} A$, then
$\Gamma\vdash_{\vec{x}}^T A$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
By the previous crucial Lemma we get $\Gamma\vdash_{\vec{x}}^{T_f} A$. We then conclude
$\Gamma\vdash_{\vec{x}}^T A$ by Lemma~\ref{subst3}.
\end{proof}

\subsection{Example}

Total preorders with a ternary predicate for maximum can be axiomatized by:
\begin{align*}
                                                 &\vdash_{x,y}           x\leq y \lor y\leq x
&\quad\text{(this implies reflexivity)}\\
x\leq y, y\leq z              &\vdash_{x,y,z}        x\leq z\\
x\leq z, y\leq z                   &\vdash_{x,y,z}           M(x,y,z)
&\quad\text{(M-intro)}\\ 
%y \leq x                                    &\vdash_{x,y}           M(x,y,x)\\
M(x,y,z)                                   &\vdash_{x,y,z}        x\leq z,  y\leq z
&\quad\text{(M-elim1)}\\
M(x,y,z), x\leq u,  y\leq u      &\vdash_{x,y,z,u}    z\leq u
&\quad\text{(M-elim2)}\\
\end{align*}
Call this theory $T_0$. Note that in a preorder maxima need not be unique.

In the following we show how to work with disjunction and existential
quantification by means of admissible rules, that is, coherent
axioms that do not give new coherent consequences. Although we
only show this for the example, the method is completely general.
Consider the following stylized derivation in the theory above:
\begin{align*}
& x\leq y, y\leq y,M(x,y,y)\\
&{\hphantom w} \lor\\
&y\leq x, x\leq x,M(x,y,x) \\
\end{align*}
This derivation shows that $\vdash_{x,y} M(x,y,x)  \lor M(x,y,y)$ is an
admissible rule. Call the extension of $T_0$ by this rule $T_1$.

Let $T_2$ be $T_1$ plus the axiom $\vdash_{x,y} \exists u M(x,y,u)$.
If $\Gamma \vdash_{\vec{x}}^{T_2} A$ has been inferred from
$\Gamma,M(x,y,u) \vdash_{\vec{x},u}^{T_1} A$ with $u$ fresh,
then by Lemma~\ref{subst1} we can substitute both $x$ and $y$ 
for the lone variable $u$ and get $\Gamma,M(x,y,x) \vdash_{\vec{x}}^{T_1} A$
and $\Gamma,M(x,y,y) \vdash_{\vec{x}}^{T_1} A$, respectively.
Hence we also have $\Gamma \vdash_{\vec{x}}^{T_1} A$
by using $\vdash_{x,y} M(x,y,x)  \lor M(x,y,y)$.
This means that $\vdash_{x,y} \exists u M(x,y,u)$ is an admissible rule
for $T_1$.

Let $T_3$ be $T_2$ plus the axiom $\vdash_{x,y} M(x,y,m(x,y))$. 
Theorem~\ref{thm:skolem} states that  $T_3$ is conservative over
$T_2$ and hence also over $T_1$ and $T_0$. This means we can add
$\vdash_{x,y} M(x,y,m(x,y))$ to $T_0$ without getting more consequences
in the signature $\set{M,{\leq}}$. This is somehow surprising since maxima
need not be unique in a preorder, so that $m(x,y)$ must make a choice.
 We will see that the same result holds even in coherent logic with equality.

%%  If we have an equality symbol, we consider that we have added all equality axioms for
%% predicate and function symbols in the theory. It follows from this Theorem that we
%% can eliminate function symbols whenever we have unique existence. 

\section{Addition of equality}

In logic with equality, when we add a function symbol $f$, 
we must also add a congruence axiom for that function. 
This means that $T_f$ in Section~\ref{sec:skolemfunction},
when extended to  logic with equality, will in fact mention $f$ . 
This invalidates the application of Lemma~\ref{subst2}, 
which requires that the theory does not mention $f$.
This means that we have to review (and adapt) the proofs of the
previous section. 

To get a clearer picture of what is needed we translate the 
counterexample~(\ref{all2exist2}) to coherent logic.
For this we need to introduce a new predicate $I(x_1,x_2,y_1,y_2)$
expressing $x_1=x_2 \to y_1=y_2$ by coherent axioms.

\begin{definition}\label{def:implicational_equality}
A theory with \emph{implicational equality} is a coherent theory which includes
the axioms:
\begin{align*}
 I(x_1,x_2,y_1,y_2), x_1=x_2 & \vdash_V                 y_1=y_2  &\text{(I-elim)}\\
 y_1=y_2                                  &\vdash_V                 I(x_1,x_2,y_1,y_2)&\text{(I-intro1)}\\ 
                                                 &\vdash_V                 I(x_1,x_2,y_1,y_2) \lor x_1= x_2&\text{(I-intro2)}
 %                                                &\vdash_{z,z'}           z=z' \lor z\neq z'\\
 %z=z' \land z\neq z'                &\vdash_{z,z'}           \bot\\
\end{align*}
Here $V$ consists of  the variables $x_1,x_2,y_1,y_2$.
We include the usual axioms of equality, but
in theories with implicational equality we state the congruence axiom for 
a unary function $f$ by $\vdash_{x,x'} I(x,x',f(x),f(x'))$.
\end{definition}

Implicational equality is conservative over equality, which can be seen be a
cut-elimination argument, see\cite[THM?]{CLR}. 
Alternatively, one can substitute $x_1=x_2 \to y_1=y_2$
for $I(x_1,x_2,y_1,y_2)$ and observe that the axioms above become
\emph{classical} tautologies. The cut-elimination argument is constructive, whereas
the alternative argument uses the conservativity of classical logic over
coherent logic (Barr's Theorem~\cite{Barr}), which is not constructive.

\begin{example}\label{exa:counter2CL}
Let $T$  be a theory with implicational equality with the $f$-axioms:
\begin{equation}\label{faxioms}
\vdash_{x,x'} I(x,x',f(x),f(x') )\quad\quad \vdash_{x} P(x,f(x))
\end{equation}
Using two new constants $a$ and $b$ we express (\ref{all2exist2}) coherently
(in one of the many possible ways):
\[
P(a,y_1),P(b,y_2),I(a,b,y_1,y_2)  \vdash_{y,y'} \bot
\]

Consider the following streamlined proof of $\bot$ in the theory above:
\begin{align*}
P(a,f(a)), P(b,f(b)),I(a,b,f(a),f(b)),\bot
\end{align*}
How to transform this derivation into one using 
$\vdash_{x} \exists u P(x,u)$ instead of the $f$-axioms 
in (\ref{faxioms}) above? Starting by $P(a,u), P(b,v)$
there is no way to conclude $u=v$ from $a=b$.
One solution is to use the instance $I(a,b,u,v) \lor a=b$ of (I-intro2).
Then the first branch is immediate, and in the second
we can infer $P(b,u)$ from $P(a,u)$ by equality reasoning and use 
the instance $I(a,b,u,u)$ of (I-intro1):
\begin{align*}
&I(a,b,u,v),\bot\\
P(a,u),P(b,v),&{\hphantom w}\lor\\
& a=b,P(b,u),I(a,b,u,u),\bot\\
\end{align*}
\end{example}




\begin{lemma}\label{lem:main}
Let $T_{I\!f{+}}$ be a coherent theory with implicational equality consisting of
axioms not mentioning $f$ plus the $f$-axioms $\vdash_{x,x'} I(x,x',f(x),f(x'))$
and $\vdash_{{y}} P({y},f({y}))$. Let $T$ be the coherent theory obtained from 
$T_{I\!f{+}}$ by leaving out the $f$-axioms and adding $\vdash_{{y}} \exists u P({y},u)$.
Then we have:
\begin{enumerate}
\item If $\Gamma,P(t,f(t)), I(t,u_1,f(t),f(u_1)),\ldots,I(t,u_n,f(t),f(u_n))\vdash_{\vec{x}}^{T} A$
and $f(t)$ does not occur in $\Gamma,A$, $u_1,\ldots,u_n$, then  
$\Gamma,\Sigma\vdash_{\vec{x}}^{T} A$, where $\Sigma$ consists of 
all $P(u_i,f(u_i))$ and $I(u_i,u_j,f(u_i),f(u_j))$;
\item If $\Gamma\vdash_{\vec{x}}^{T_{I\!f{+}}} A$ and $\Sigma$ contains all $P(t,f(t))$ and
$I(t,u,f(t),f(u))$ such that $f(t)$ and $f(u)$ occur in $\Gamma,A$,
then $\Gamma,\Sigma\vdash_{\vec{x}}^{T} A$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
1. By Lemma~\ref{subst2} we can substitute a fresh variable $y$ for $f(t)$ and get:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:ft=y}
\Gamma,P(t,y),  I(t,u_1,y,f(u_1)),\ldots,I(t,u_n,y,f(u_n))\vdash_{\vec{x},y}^{T} A
\end{equation}
Note that $t=u_i,y=f(u_i),\Gamma,\Sigma\vdash_{\vec{x},y}^{T} A$,
for any $i$, follows from (\ref{eq:ft=y}) by weakening and equality reasoning:
get $P(t,y)$ from $P(u_i,f(u_i))\in\Sigma$, and get each $I(t,u_j,y,f(u_j))$ 
from $I(u_i,u_j,f(u_i),f(u_j))\in\Sigma$. 
By substituting $f(u_i)$ for the
lone variable $y$ we get $(\ast)~t=u_i,\Gamma,\Sigma\vdash_{\vec{x}}^{T} A$
by Lemma~\ref{subst1} and reflexivity.

Now build a proof of $\Gamma,\Sigma\vdash_{\vec{x}}^{T} A$ from first 
$\Gamma,\Sigma,P(t,y)\vdash_{\vec{x},y}^{T} A$ and then repeated
application of the rule (I-intro2) with $I(t,u_i,y,f(u_i)) \lor t=u_i$. 
All right branches are closed by weakening  $(\ast)$. As a result the derivation
is left-leaning and the leftmost branch of length $n$ is closed by
weakening (\ref{eq:ft=y}).

2. By induction on the derivation of $\Gamma\vdash_{\vec{x}}^{T_{I\!f{+}}} A$.
There are three cases to distinguish, depending on the last step in the derivation.
In all cases we have to prove $\Gamma,\Sigma\vdash_{\vec{x}}^{T} A$.

Case $P(t,f(t))$. By induction we have 
\begin{equation}\label{ih:Ptft}
\Gamma,\Sigma,P(t,f(t)), I(t,u_1,f(t),f(u_1)),\ldots,I(t,u_n,f(t),f(u_n))\vdash_{\vec{x}}^{T} A
\end{equation}
where $\Sigma$ consists of all $P(u_i,f(u_i))$ and $I(u_i,u_j,f(u_i),f(u_j))$
with $f(u_i),f(u_j)$ in $\Gamma,A$. 
If $f(t)$ occurs in $\Gamma,A$ we are done.
Otherwise we apply part 1 and we are also done.

Case $I(s,t,f(s),f(t))$. By induction we have 
\begin{equation}\label{ih:Istfsft}
\Gamma,I(s,t,f(s),f(t)),\Sigma'\vdash_{\vec{x}}^{T} A
\end{equation}
where $\Sigma'$ consists of all $P(u_i,f(u_i))$ and $I(u_i,u_j,f(u_i),f(u_j))$
with $f(u_i),f(u_j)$ in $\Gamma,A,f(s),f(t)$. 
Let $\Sigma$ consists of all $P(u_i,f(u_i))$ and $I(u_i,u_j,f(u_i),f(u_j))$
with $f(u_i),f(u_j)$ in $\Gamma,A$.
Modulo idempotence, reflexivity and symmetry we get:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:sigmas}
\Sigma' = \Sigma,P(s,f(s)),P(t,f(t)),I(s,t,f(s),f(t)),\ldots,I(s,u_i,f(s),f(u_i)),\ldots,I(t,u_i,f(t),f(u_i)),\ldots
\end{equation}
If $f(s),f(t)$ both in $\Gamma,A$,
then $\Sigma'=\Sigma$ and we are done. Otherwise, there are several cases
to distinguish. If $f(s)$ in $\Gamma,A$ but not $f(t)$, then we are done by part 1,
and likewise for $f(t)$ in $\Gamma,A$ but not $f(s)$. The case that neither
$f(s)$ nor $f(t)$ is in $\Gamma,A$ can be further split into subcases. First, if $s$ and $t$
are identical, then we are done by part 1. If not, and if $f(t)$ is not a subterm of $s$,
then we are done by two applications of part 1, first for $f(t)$, then for $f(s)$.
If $f(t)$ is a subterm of $s$, then $f(s)$ is not a subterm of $t$, and we are 
again done by two applications of part 1.

Case of any axiom not mentioning $f$. Then we have an axiom
$$
\Delta_0(\vec{y})~\vdash_{\vec{y}}~
\exists \vec{z_1}\Delta_1(\vec{y},\vec{z_1})\vee\dots\vee\exists \vec{z_n}\Delta_n(\vec{y},\vec{z_n})
$$
in $T$ and terms $\vec{t}$ with free variables in $\vec{x}$ such
that $\Delta_0(\vec{t})$ is a subset of $\Gamma$ and we have
$\Gamma,\Delta_i(\vec{t},\vec{z_i})\vdash_{\vec{x},\vec{z_i}}^{T_{I\!f{+}}} A$ 
for $i=1,\dots,n$.
By induction we have $\Gamma,\Delta_i(\vec{t},\vec{z_i}), \Sigma_i\vdash_{\vec{x},\vec{z_i}}^{T} A$
for $i = 1,\dots,n$, where $\Sigma_i$ is the set of formulae $P(u_j,f(u_j))$ and $I(u_j,u_k,f(u_j),f(u_k))$
with $f(u_j),f(u_k)$ in in $\Gamma,A,\Delta_i(\vec{t},\vec{z_i})$.
Since $\Delta_i(\vec{y},\vec{z_i})$ does not mention $f$, all $f$-terms in
$\Sigma_i$  either occur in $\Gamma,A$, or are subterms of $\vec{t}$, so with
all free variables in $\vec{x}$. It follows that we have
$\Gamma,\Sigma_1,\dots,\Sigma_n\vdash_{\vec{x}}^{T} A$
by the same instance of the same axiom above. Now use part 1 to eliminate
all $f$-terms not occurring in $\Gamma,A$, starting by the maximal ones.
\end{proof}

\section{Examples}

\subsection{Algebraically closed field}

 We can take $T$ be the theory of algebraically closed field. This theory
has for axioms the equational theory of rings together with the rules
$$
\vdash_x x = 0 \vee \exists y~(xy = 1)~~~~~~~~~~~~
\vdash_{x_1,\dots,x_n} \exists x~(x^n = x_1 x^{n-1} + \dots + x_n)
$$which require

 We can prove in this theory
$$
\vdash_{x} \exists u~ (x(1-ux) = 0)
$$
in this theory. Hence we can introduce a function $inv(x)$ with the axiom
$x(1 -inv(x) x) = 0$ and we get a conservative extension. 

 Another example with the same theory is to introduce a function $sqrt(x)$ with the axiom
$sqrt(x)^2 = x$. Since we have $\vdash_{x} \exists u~(u^2 = x)$, we also get a conservative
extension.

 For this example, notice that we have models of the theory (for instance the model described
in \cite{Mannaa}) where there is no square root function.

\subsection{Local rings}

 Another example is the the theory of local rings, given by the equational theory of rings
with the rules
$$
0=1\vdash\bot~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\vdash_x inv(x)\vee inv(1-x)
$$
where $inv(x)$ means $\exists y~(xy = 1)$. 

 The generic model is given by the site of finitely presented rings with covering
$R\rightarrow R[1/x_i]$ for $1 = \ideal{x_1,\dots,x_n}$ (we can have $n = 0$ if $1=0$ in $R$).

 We can prove in this theory
$$
\vdash_x \exists y~z~(x y = 1~\vee ~(1-x) z = 1)
$$
hence it is possible in a conservative way
to introduce two skolem functions $J(x)$ and $K(x)$ with the rule
$$
\vdash_x xJ(x) = 1~\vee~(1-x)K(x) = 1
$$

 There are no such functions for the generic model since these functions should be defined
at all levels and $\ints$ is not a local ring.
(All functions on the generic local rings are polynomials but we don't need to use this fact.)

\medskip

 Despite the fact that the conservativity can be proved in a simple way, in the last case, we
have no Skolem function in the generic model, and thus, we cannot simply rely on a semantical
argument.

\section{Remarks about a question of Gavin Wraith}

Let $\vdash_i$ and $\vdash_c$ mean derivability in intuitionistic and classical logic,
respectively. Given a coherent theory $T$, 
a sentence $\psi$ is called $T$-\emph{redundant} by
Wraith~\cite[p. 336]{Wraith}\footnote{The difference
between geometric logic and coherent logic is not relevant for our remarks here.},
if for any coherent $\phi$ we have
$\vdash^T \phi$ whenever $T,\psi \vdash_i \phi$.
Known sources of $T$-redundancy are:
\begin{enumerate}
\item $T \vdash_i \psi$, including the case that $\psi$ is coherent.
In this case $T$-redundancy is obvious.
\item $T \vdash_c \psi$. In this case $T$-redundancy follows from the conservativity
of classical logic over coherent logic (Barr's Theorem, or a cut-elimination argument.)
\item $\psi$ is true in the generic model of $T$. In this case $T$-redundancy is
has been observed by Kock~\ref{Kock} as a consequence of the (coherent) completeness
of the generic model.
\item $\psi$ is true in some other model of $T$ that is complete for coherent 
sentences. This case can be understood in the same way as the previous one: 
if $T,\psi \vdash_i \phi$, then $T \vdash_i \psi\to\phi$, so $\psi\to\phi$ is true in
the model of $T$, and so is $\phi$, hence $\vdash^{T} \phi$ by completeness.
\end{enumerate}
These points need not exclude each other.

Wraith~\cite[p. 336]{Wraith} asks furthermore whether every $T$-redundant
sentence is true in the generic model. This is clearly true for the points 1 and 3 above.
However, it need not be true if the $T$-redundancy comes from point 2 or 4.
Perhaps the easiest negative answer to Wraith's question is the case of
the empty theory $T$ over the signature with only a propositional variable $p$.
Then $p\lor\neg p$ is $T$-redundant, but not true in the generic model of $T$
(.

 and it is unknown whether the list 
is exhaustive.


We take the language with $=$ and a binary relation $R$. The theory $T$ has the rule
$\vdash_x \exists y~R(x,y)$. As an application of what we have seen, we can add
in a conservative way a function symbol $f$ with a congruence axiom
and the axiom $\vdash _y R(y,f(y))$ and get a theory $T_{I\!f{+}}$ which is conservative over 
$T$ for {\em coherent} formulae. 

 This theory however is \emph{not} conservative for arbitrary formulae since we can prove in
$T_{I\!f{+}}$ the non coherent formula
$$
\exists y_1~y_2~(R(x_1,y_1)\wedge R(x_2,y_2)\wedge (x_1=x_2\rightarrow y_1=y_2))\leqno{(**)}
$$
which is not provable in $T$.

 We show that this theory is \emph{not} valid in the generic model of $T$, answering
in this way a question of Gavin Wraith \cite{Wraith}. The generic model can be described
in the following way. It is a site model. The object of the site are relations (graphs)
$I,R_I$ on a finite set
and morphisms maps $f:I\rightarrow J$ which preserve the relation: if $R_I(i_0,i_1)$
then $R_J(f(i_0),f(i_1))$. A basic covering of $I,R_I$ is obtained by choosing an element $i$
in $I$ and adding a fresh element $I\rightarrow I,j$ and the relation $R(i,j)$.
The covariant functor $(I,R_I)\longmapsto I$ satisfies the sheaf condition and is the domain
of the generic model. 
(Note that $I$ is precisely the set of all terms with variables in $I$ as the
signature contains no function symbols.)
We define $(I,R_I)\Vdash\varphi$ by induction on $\varphi$ as usual.
It can then be checked that the formula $(**)$ above is not forced.
Details can be found in \cite{BBC18}.

\subsection{Alternative proof}



\begin{lemma}\label{lem:upfront}
Let $T$ consist of axioms not
mentioning $f$ plus the axiom $\vdash_{\vec{y}} P(\vec{y},f(\vec{y}))$.
Assume all free variables of $\vec{t}$ are in $\vec{x}$. 
If $\Gamma\vdash_{\vec{x}}^T A$, 
then $\Gamma,P(\vec{t},f(\vec{t}))\vdash_{\vec{x}}^T A$
by a derivation not using the instance $P(\vec{t},f(\vec{t}))$
of the only axiom in $T$ mentioning $f$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
The base case is trivial.
The only induction step that is not trivial is when the last step
of the derivation infers $\Gamma\vdash_{\vec{x}}^T A$
from $\Gamma,P(\vec{t},f(\vec{t}))\vdash_{\vec{x}}^T A$.
Now use the induction hypothesis and the idempotency of sets.
\end{proof}

The combination of the previous two lemmas allows us to replace
(under suitable conditions ensuring the eigenvariable condition)
applications of $\vdash_{\vec{y}} P(\vec{y},f(\vec{y}))$
by $\vdash_{\vec{y}} \exists u P(\vec{y},u)$.

\begin{lemma}\label{lem:elimPtft}
Let $T$ consist of axioms not mentioning $f$ including 
$\vdash_{\vec{y}} \exists u P(\vec{y},u)$,  
plus the axiom $\vdash_{\vec{y}} P(\vec{y},f(\vec{y}))$.
Assume all free variables of $\vec{t}$ are in $\vec{x}$, and
that $\Gamma,A$ does not mention $f(\vec{t})$.
If $\Gamma\vdash_{\vec{x}}^T A$, 
then $\Gamma\vdash_{\vec{x}}^T A$
by a derivation not using the instance $P(\vec{t},f(\vec{t}))$
of the only axiom in $T$ mentioning $f$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Apply Lemma~\ref{lem:upfront} to get a suitable derivation of 
$\Gamma,P(\vec{t},f(\vec{t}))\vdash_{\vec{x}}^T A$.
Let $\rho = \rho_{f(\vec{t}),u}$ for a fresh variable $u$
and apply Lemma~\ref{subst3} to get 
$\Gamma\rho,P(\vec{t},u)\vdash_{\vec{x},u}^T A\rho$.
Now apply $(\Gamma,A)\rho=\Gamma,A$ to ensure the eigenvariable
condition and use the axiom $\vdash_{\vec{y}} \exists u P(\vec{y},u)$ to get
$\Gamma\vdash_{\vec{x}}^T A$ as desired.
\end{proof}

By iterating the previous lemma we can prove Skolem's Theorem by eliminating
applications of $\vdash_{\vec{y}} P(\vec{y},f(\vec{y}))$ one by one.
The only difficulty is to ensure that the eigenvariable condition holds.

\begin{theorem}\label{thm:altskolem}
Let $T$ consist of axioms not mentioning $f$ including 
$\vdash_{\vec{y}} \exists u P(\vec{y},u)$,  
plus the axiom $\vdash_{\vec{y}} P(\vec{y},f(\vec{y}))$.
If  $\Gamma,A$ does not mention $f$ and $\Gamma\vdash_{\vec{x}}^{T} A$, then
$\Gamma\vdash_{\vec{x}}^T A$ by a derivation not using
$\vdash_{\vec{y}} P(\vec{y},f(\vec{y}))$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
By induction on the number of applications of $\vdash_{\vec{y}} P(\vec{y},f(\vec{y}))$.
If the derivation of $\Gamma\vdash_{\vec{x}}^{T} A$ uses an instance
$P(\vec{t},f(\vec{t}))$ with all variables in $\vec{x}$, then we can eliminate this instance
(all occurrences)
by Lemma~\ref{lem:elimPtft} and get a derivation with fewer applications of 
$\vdash_{\vec{y}} P(\vec{y},f(\vec{y}))$. Now assume there is an instance
$P(\vec{t},f(\vec{t}))$ with some variable not in $\vec{x}$. Move up from the root
of the derivation to that instance to the \emph{first} position
$\Gamma,\Delta\vdash_{\vec{x},\vec{y},\vec{z}} A$ such that
$\vec{t}$ has all its variables in $\vec{x},\vec{y},\vec{z}$. This means that $\vec{t}$
has some variable not in $\vec{x},\vec{y}$ and that, consequently, 
$\Delta$ does not mention $f(\vec{t})$. Now we can apply Lemma~\ref{lem:elimPtft}
to the subderivation and get again a derivation with fewer applications of 
$\vdash_{\vec{y}} P(\vec{y},f(\vec{y}))$.
\end{proof}

In the above proof, the resulting derivation could still mention $f$, even
without using $\vdash_{\vec{y}} P(\vec{y},f(\vec{y}))$. 
In order to completely eliminate $f$, use Lemma~\ref{subst3} as described after
its proof.
