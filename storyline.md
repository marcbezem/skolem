(I) = introductory, informal (D) = detailed

1. (I) Skolem's Theorem in classical logic
* conservativity, semantically, AC
* conservativity, proof theoretically (Maehara)

2. (I) Skolem's Theorem in intuitionistic logic
* not conservative, (D) example
* remark: Maehara's proof transformation is constructive, but the resulting proofs are not
* conservative with uniqueness

3. (D) Coherent logic
