(I) = introductory, informal (D) = detailed

1. (I) Skolem's Theorem in classical logic
* conservativity, semantically, AC
* conservativity, proof theoretically (Maehara)

2. (I) Skolem's Theorem in intuitionistic logic
* not conservative, (D) example
  - the last formula of the example is not provable _because_ it is not forced
  (a Kripke countermodel also exists, but we don't need that)
* remark: Maehara's proof transformation is constructive, but the resulting proofs are not
* conservative with uniqueness

3. (D) Coherent logic, proof theory
* (I) conservativity of classical logic (Barr)
* (D) Skolem's Theorem for coherent logic
* remark: both the proof transformation and the resulting proofs are constructive
* (D) example revisted, last formula is redundant: new counterexample to Wraith's question
